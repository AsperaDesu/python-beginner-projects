# 🐍 Python Beginner Projects

An archive of small Python scripts and exercises from my early programming course — a collection of random assignments, experiments, and practice files created while learning the basics of Python syntax, logic, and problem-solving.

---

## 📘 Overview

This repository contains a variety of beginner-level programs such as:
- Basic math and geometry exercises  
- Small algorithmic problems (sorting, searching, etc.)  
- Console-based mini projects and practice scripts  

Each file reflects a different stage of learning — from understanding variables and loops to experimenting with functions and conditions.

---

## ⚙️ How to Run

To try any script, simply clone the repository and run a file:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AsperaDesu/python-beginner-projects.git
cd python-beginner-projects
python filename.py
```

No external libraries or dependencies are required — everything runs with standard Python 3.

## 💡 Notes

- This repository is not a polished project, just a record of my early learning process.
- Code quality varies — some scripts may be messy or unoptimized on purpose for practice.
- Feel free to explore if you’re just starting out or curious about beginner exercises!
